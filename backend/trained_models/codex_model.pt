The file "backend/trained_models/codex_model.pt" is a PyTorch model file. It is a binary file that contains the weights of a trained model, and it is not human-readable or writable. This file would be generated by training a model using the OpenAI Codex API and then saving the model's state_dict with PyTorch's torch.save() function.

As an AI text model, I'm unable to train models or generate binary files. However, I can provide a Python code snippet that demonstrates how one might train a model and save it as "codex_model.pt". Here is an example:

```python
import torch
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Initialize the model and tokenizer
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Train the model here...

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "backend/trained_models/codex_model.pt")
```

Please note that this is a simplified example and actual model training involves preparing a dataset, defining a loss function and an optimizer, running the training loop, and more.
